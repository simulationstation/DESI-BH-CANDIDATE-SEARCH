# Priority A RV Variable Candidates - Observer Packet

## Summary

This packet contains 39 Priority A candidates selected from DESI DR1
Milky Way Survey radial velocity measurements. These are stars showing
statistically significant RV variability that warrants spectroscopic follow-up.

**This is NOT a claim of compact object companions.** These are RV-variable
candidates only. The variability could be due to:
- Binary companions (stellar or sub-stellar)
- Pulsations or other intrinsic variability
- Systematic effects or bad spectral fits

## Candidate Counts

| Survey | Tier A Total | Priority A (S_robust >= 10) |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Bright | varies | 11 |
| Dark | varies | 28 |
| Master (deduped) | - | 39 |

## Selection Criteria

Candidates passed these data-driven gates:

1. **Tier A only**: N_epochs >= 3 (at least 3 RV measurements)
2. **S_robust >= 10**: Conservative significance score
   - S_robust = min(S, S_min_LOO) where S_min_LOO is the minimum
     significance when any single epoch is dropped
   - This guards against single-epoch flukes
3. **MJD_span >= 0.5 days**: Observations span at least half a day

## Metric Definitions

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| S | ΔRV_max / sqrt(Σ σ_i²) - original significance |
| S_robust | min(S, S_min_LOO) - conservative significance |
| S_min_LOO | Minimum S when any single epoch is dropped |
| d_max | max_i |RV_i - median(RV)| / σ_i - outlier leverage |
| ΔRV | max(RV) - min(RV) in km/s |

## Flags in Notes Column

- **LOO-stable**: S_min_LOO / S > 0.8 (signal robust to dropping any epoch)
- **LOO-moderate**: 0.5 < S_min_LOO / S <= 0.8
- **LOO-drops**: S_min_LOO / S <= 0.5 (signal depends on one epoch)
- **high-leverage(d=X)**: d_max > 100 (one epoch far from median)
- **N=X**: Number of epochs (N=3 is minimum for Tier A)

## What "Needs Follow-up" Means

All candidates in this list need additional observations to:
1. Confirm the RV variability with independent measurements
2. Characterize the orbit (if binary)
3. Rule out systematic effects

High-priority targets for follow-up:
- **LOO-stable** with **N >= 4**: Most robust signals
- **Large MJD_span**: Better orbital phase coverage
- **Moderate d_max**: Less likely to be single-epoch artifacts

## Data Provenance

- Source: DESI DR1 Milky Way Survey "iron" VAC
- Files: rvpix_exp-main-bright.fits, rvpix_exp-main-dark.fits

## Caveats

1. **No orbit fitting performed**: ΔRV is max-min, not orbital amplitude
2. **No stellar parameter cuts**: No filtering by Teff, logg, [Fe/H], etc.
3. **Missing Gaia IDs**: Some targets have no Gaia SOURCE_ID (empty in CSV)
4. **VRAD_ERR is quoted pipeline uncertainty**: May not reflect true errors
5. **Per-measurement quality cuts applied**: VRAD_ERR < 10 km/s, |VRAD| < 500 km/s
