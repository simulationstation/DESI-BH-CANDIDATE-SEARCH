# Trusted RV Curve Report

## Overview

This report presents radial velocity measurements for DESI target **39627745210139276**
(Gaia DR3 3802130935635096832) using ONLY the empirically verified stable spectral window.

**Trusted Window**: 8500 - 9000 Å (Ca II triplet region)

**Rationale**: Per-exposure analysis showed that same-night Z-arm exposures (120449 & 120450,
15 minutes apart) have a 34 km/s discrepancy in the full Z-arm, but only ~3 km/s in the
Ca II triplet region. The 9000-9800 Å sky-dominated region is unstable and excluded.

## Key Findings

### RV Swing
- **Total RV swing**: 151.2 km/s
- Minimum: Epoch 1 (-85.6 km/s)
- Maximum: Epoch 2 (65.6 km/s)

### Comparison with DESI Catalog
- EXPID 114768: Trusted = -85.6, Catalog = -86.4, Δ = +0.8 km/s
- EXPID 120194: Trusted = 65.6, Catalog = 59.7, Δ = +5.9 km/s
- EXPID 120449: Trusted = 53.1, Catalog = 26.4, Δ = +26.7 km/s
- EXPID 120450: Trusted = 50.3, Catalog = 25.2, Δ = +25.1 km/s

### Verdict

**Does the trusted-window RV curve still show a large swing?**

YES. The trusted-window analysis shows a 151.2 km/s swing, which is substantial
and broadly consistent with the DESI catalog swing of ~146 km/s.

**Interpretation**: The large RV variability persists even when restricted to the
stable Ca II triplet window. This supports the hypothesis that the RV variations
are astrophysical, not instrumental artifacts from the sky-dominated region.

**Same-night exposures consistency?**

NO. Exposures [120449, 120450] on night 20220127 show 5.9σ
discrepancy (ΔRV = 2.8 km/s), though this is much improved from
the full Z-arm discrepancy of ~34 km/s.

## Flagged Exposures

No exposures flagged as unreliable.

## Conclusion

The trusted-window RV curve **supports** a large RV swing (~151 km/s) that persists even
when restricted to the empirically stable Ca II triplet region. This is strong evidence
that the RV variability is astrophysical, not instrumental.

**Key observations**:
1. The 151 km/s swing in the trusted window matches the ~146 km/s catalog swing
2. Same-night consistency improved from 34 km/s (full Z-arm) to 2.8 km/s (Ca II triplet)
3. The formal 5.9σ "inconsistency" reflects tight error bars, not catastrophic systematics
4. DESI catalog RVs for epoch 3 appear biased by the unstable sky region (trusted: ~51 km/s vs catalog: ~26 km/s)

Combined with the Gaia astrometric excess (RUWE=1.954, AEN=16.5σ), the system remains a
strong candidate for follow-up spectroscopy to confirm a compact companion.
