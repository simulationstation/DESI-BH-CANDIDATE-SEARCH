# Deep-Dive Analysis: TARGETID 39628001431785529

## Target Identification

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| TARGETID | 39628001431785529 |
| Gaia SOURCE_ID | 2759088365339967488 |
| SIMBAD ID | **SDSS J235252.06+084235.4** |
| SIMBAD Classification | **QSO (Quasar)** |
| RA, Dec | 358.2169°, +8.7098° |
| G magnitude | 18.99 |
| BP-RP | 0.79 |

## Question 1: How many DESI RV epochs does this object truly have?

| Count | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Raw matches across all FITS files |
| 5 | Unique epochs (no duplicates) |
| **4** | Epochs passing quality cuts (RV_ERR < 10, \|RV\| < 500) |

One epoch (EXPID 108183) was excluded due to RV_ERR = 127 km/s.

---

## Question 2: Does the RV variability remain strong after de-duplication?

**Yes.** The metrics are essentially unchanged:

| Metric | Original | Recomputed |
|--------|----------|------------|
| N_epochs | 4 | 4 |
| ΔRV_max | 822.86 km/s | 822.86 km/s |
| S | 91.12 | 91.12 |
| S_robust | 91.12 | 91.12 |
| d_max | 101.22 | 101.22 |
| MJD_span | 10.97 days | 10.97 days |

---

## Question 3: Is d_max driven by one epoch or multiple?

**Multiple epochs contribute comparably to d_max.**

| Epoch | MJD | RV (km/s) | d_i |
|-------|-----|-----------|-----|
| 1 | 59518.21 | -324.62 | 92.35 |
| 2 | 59527.18 | +471.51 | **101.22** (max) |
| 3 | 59528.17 | +483.02 | 75.59 |
| 4 | 59529.17 | -339.83 | 97.01 |

The RV swing is **spread across multiple epochs** — removing any single epoch
preserves >98% of the total ΔRV. This is NOT a single-epoch fluke.

---

## Question 4: Are the extreme RV points supported by normal-quality measurements?

**Partially — but with concerning flags.**

| Epoch | RV (km/s) | SN_R | SUCCESS | RVS_WARN | Quality |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| Max (+483) | +483.02 | 13.90 | **True** | 0 | Normal |
| Min (-340) | -339.83 | 20.96 | **False** | **8** | Flagged |

- **2 of 4 epochs have SUCCESS=False** (DESI RV pipeline flagged issues)
- **Both negative-RV epochs have RVS_WARN=8** (template mismatch warning)
- SNR is consistent across all epochs (13.9–21.0, median 17.0)

The extreme negative RV measurements are flagged as potentially unreliable
by the DESI pipeline itself.

---

## Question 5: Is there anything in Gaia DR3 that would obviously explain RV artifacts?

**Yes — and it is decisive.**

| Gaia Property | Value | Assessment |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| RUWE | 1.073 | Normal (≤1.4) |
| Excess noise sig | 2.41 | Slightly elevated |
| Parallax | 1.02 ± 0.27 mas | Marginally significant |
| Non-single star | 0 | Not flagged |

However, **SIMBAD classification is QSO** (SDSS J235252.06+084235.4).

This is the critical finding:
- The "RV variability" is **not orbital motion**
- It reflects **emission line shifts** from quasar activity
- The ~800 km/s RV swing is entirely consistent with AGN behavior
- The RVS_WARN=8 flags indicate **template mismatch** (stellar template vs. AGN spectrum)
- The SUCCESS=False epochs are **expected** for non-stellar spectra

---

## Summary

This object was already correctly classified as `AGN_QSO` in the pipeline output
and excluded from the `priorityA_followup_only.csv` subset.

The deep-dive confirms:
1. **4 genuine RV epochs** exist (not inflated by duplicates)
2. **RV variability is statistically robust** (S=91, spread across epochs)
3. **However, this is a known QSO** — the RV "variability" is AGN emission, not orbital motion
4. **DESI pipeline flags (SUCCESS=False, RVS_WARN=8)** correctly indicate spectral issues

---

## FOLLOW-UP RELEVANCE:

**WEAKENED to NOT RELEVANT** — This object is a quasar (SDSS J235252.06+084235.4),
not a stellar binary candidate. The RV variability reflects AGN emission line shifts,
not orbital motion. It was correctly excluded from the follow-up list and should
remain excluded.
