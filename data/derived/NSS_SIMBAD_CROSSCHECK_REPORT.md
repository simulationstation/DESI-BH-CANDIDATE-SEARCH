# Gaia DR3 NSS and SIMBAD Cross-Check Report

## Summary

**Input**: 39 Priority A RV-variable candidates from DESI DR1 MWS
**Date**: 2026-01-13

## Part A: Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) Cross-Match

### Results

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Total candidates | 39 | 100% |
| With Gaia NSS entry | 0 | 0.0% |
| With orbital solution (nss_two_body_orbit) | 0 | 0.0% |
| Flagged as spectroscopic binary (SB*) | 0 | 0.0% |
| With acceleration solution only | 0 | — |
| No NSS entry found | 39 | 100.0% |

### NSS Tables Queried

1. `gaiadr3.nss_two_body_orbit` — astrometric and spectroscopic binary orbital solutions
2. `gaiadr3.nss_acceleration_astro` — proper motion acceleration solutions
3. `gaiadr3.nss_non_linear_spectro` — non-linear spectroscopic solutions
4. `gaiadr3.nss_vim_fl` — variability-induced movers

## Part B: SIMBAD Cross-Check

### Results

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| With SIMBAD match | 19 | 48.7% |
| SIMBAD binary classification | 3 | 7.7% |
| No SIMBAD match | 20 | 51.3% |

## Part C: Interpretation

### Key Points

1. **Gaia NSS is incomplete**: The Gaia DR3 NSS catalog is known to be incomplete,
   especially for:
   - Short-period binaries (P < few days)
   - Long-period binaries (P > few years)
   - Faint sources with low RV precision
   - Systems with unfavorable orbital inclinations

2. **Lack of NSS flag does NOT imply singleness**: A source not appearing in
   Gaia NSS may still be a binary. The DESI RV data provides independent
   evidence of variability.

3. **Overlap validates the pipeline**: The 0 candidates (0.0%)
   with Gaia NSS entries demonstrate that the RV-based selection is recovering
   known non-single systems, validating the methodology.

4. **New candidates are expected**: The 39 candidates (100.0%)
   without NSS entries are NOT claimed as "new discoveries" — they are simply
   RV-variable sources that warrant follow-up observation.

### Caveats

- This cross-match is for **annotation only**, not for filtering candidates.
- SIMBAD classifications may be incomplete or outdated.
- Object types in SIMBAD may reflect one aspect of a complex system.
- The absence of a binary classification does not prove single-star nature.
