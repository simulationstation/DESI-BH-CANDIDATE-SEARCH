# Gaia DR3 NSS and SIMBAD Cross-Check Report (Revised)

## Summary

**Input**: 39 Priority A RV-variable candidates from DESI DR1 MWS
**Date**: 2026-01-13

---

## Part A: Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) Cross-Match

### Results

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Total candidates | 39 | 100% |
| With Gaia NSS entry | 0 | 0.0% |
| With orbital solution (nss_two_body_orbit) | 0 | 0.0% |
| Flagged as spectroscopic binary (SB*) | 0 | 0.0% |
| With acceleration solution only | 0 | — |
| No NSS entry found | 39 | 100.0% |

### NSS Tables Queried

1. `gaiadr3.nss_two_body_orbit` — astrometric and spectroscopic binary orbital solutions
2. `gaiadr3.nss_acceleration_astro` — proper motion acceleration solutions
3. `gaiadr3.nss_non_linear_spectro` — non-linear spectroscopic solutions
4. `gaiadr3.nss_vim_fl` — variability-induced movers

### Interpretation of Zero NSS Matches

The absence of Gaia DR3 NSS matches for all 39 candidates is **expected and does not
imply singleness**. The Gaia DR3 NSS catalog has known incompleteness:

- **Short-period binaries** (P < few days): Insufficient time baseline for Gaia RVS
- **Long-period binaries** (P > few years): Orbital motion not resolved in DR3 timespan
- **Faint sources**: Low RV precision prevents detection of variability
- **Unfavorable inclinations**: Face-on orbits show minimal RV signal
- **Complex spectra**: Sources with emission, rotation, or unusual features may be excluded

The DESI RV data provides independent evidence of variability on different timescales
and with different systematics than Gaia RVS. No conclusions about binary nature
can be drawn from the lack of NSS overlap.

## Part B: SIMBAD Cross-Check

### Results

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| With SIMBAD match | 19 | 48.7% |
| No SIMBAD match | 20 | 51.3% |

### Breakdown of SIMBAD Object Types

| Object Type | Count | Implication |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| RR Lyrae (RR*) | 11 | Pulsating variable — RV variability expected |
| QSO/AGN | 4 | Active galactic nucleus — RV variability expected |
| Eclipsing binary (EB*) | 2 | Known binary system |
| BY Draconis (BY*) | 1 | Chromospherically active binary |
| Generic star (*) | 1 | No specific classification |
| No SIMBAD entry | 20 | Unknown or uncatalogued |

### What SIMBAD Classifications Mean

- **RR Lyrae (RR*)**: These are pulsating variable stars. Their RV variability is
  intrinsic to the stellar atmosphere, not due to orbital motion. They should NOT
  be followed up as binary candidates.

- **QSO/AGN**: These are extragalactic sources (quasars). Their RV "variability"
  reflects emission-line shifts from AGN activity, not orbital motion. They should
  NOT be followed up as stellar binary candidates.

- **Eclipsing binaries (EB*) and BY Draconis (BY*)**: These are already known
  binary systems. Follow-up may be useful for characterization but they are not
  new discoveries.

- **No SIMBAD entry**: These are either genuinely uncatalogued or have insufficient
  archival data. These are the primary candidates for follow-up spectroscopy.

## Part C: Recommendations

### Candidates Worth Following Up

Of the 39 Priority A candidates:
- **20 have no SIMBAD classification** and remain candidates for companion searches
- **3 are known binaries** (EB*, BY*) — already characterized, lower priority
- **11 are RR Lyrae** — pulsating stars, not binary candidates
- **4 are QSOs** — extragalactic, not relevant for stellar companion searches
- **1 is a generic star** — may warrant follow-up

### Candidates to Exclude from Companion Searches

The following should be explicitly excluded from follow-up for compact companions:
- All RR Lyrae (intrinsic pulsators)
- All QSO/AGN (extragalactic)

### Summary

| Category | Count | Follow-up? |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Unknown (no SIMBAD) | 20 | YES — primary targets |
| Generic star (*) | 1 | YES — low priority |
| Known binaries (EB*, BY*) | 3 | OPTIONAL — already known |
| RR Lyrae | 11 | NO — pulsating variables |
| QSO/AGN | 4 | NO — extragalactic |

## Caveats

- This cross-match is for **annotation only**, not for filtering the statistical sample.
- SIMBAD classifications may be incomplete or outdated.
- Object types in SIMBAD may reflect one aspect of a complex system.
- The absence of a binary classification does not prove single-star nature.
- The absence of a SIMBAD entry does not imply the source is unstudied.
